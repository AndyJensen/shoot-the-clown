# Shoot the Clown [WIP]
This project serves to digitize a 1960's arcade game made by Chicago Coin called Shoot the Clown. I'm writing this in Javascript because [Atwood's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Atwood#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAny%20application%20that%20can%20be%20written%20in%20JavaScript%2C%20will%20eventually%20be%20written%20in%20JavaScript.%E2%80%9D) is a reality that we all must accept.

Once the software is completed, I plan on building a physical arcade cabinet to run it in.

Here's a [link](http://www.pinrepair.com/arcade/shootcl.htm) to some photos of the cabinet.

Boilerplate Vue README is below and will be replaced at a later date.
